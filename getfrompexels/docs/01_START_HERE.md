# What is GetFromPexels, exactly?
So, you want to understand how to use this library in greater detail? This directory will provide you with the details on it.<br><br>
GetFromPexels is a _wrapper_ for the Pexels API - It's a library that does the hard (not really) work of constructing HTTPS requests to the Pexels API for you, and instead allows you to use
the classes and functions provided by the file to ease your usage of the Pexels API.<br><br>
Imagine wanting to send a package to someone. Instead of going to the post office yourself, you get someone else to do it and tell them all the needed details - That "person to call" is the wrapper, and the post office is the API.<br><br>
Please note that there are some other wrappers for the Pexels API available, in several programming languages. There are also other Python wrappers that you may wish to use instead of GetFromPexels.<br><br>
GetFromPexels has been made __specifically to do everything the Pexels API lets its users do__, and it aims to add additional functionality built on top of the provided cases, such as downloading media.
The library is not meant to do anything that is completely unrelated to using Pexels, just like any other type of wrapper that exists.

# How do I get it?
Simply typing this in the terminal will do it:<br>
`pip install getfrompexels`<br>
Or...<br>
`python3 -m pip install getfrompexels`<br>
This is because this library is hosted on PyPI like any other library that you install with `pip`. Alternatively, you can just download the entire `getfrompexels` package and fit it inside
your project.

# Where do I go from this?

Alternatively, you can look at the `.md` files that aren't numbered. They will contain documentation for their respective classes instead.
